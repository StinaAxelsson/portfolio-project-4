# Project Description
This project is developed as my 4th portfolio project during my course at Code Institute and I call it Utopi'Ally Community.
Utopi'Ally Community is a social media website, where you can register an account, login and create a user profile. You can upload posts with text and images on a feed for others to like and comment. You can follow other users and get along with them in a private chat. It is a small and friendly community for spiritual awaken people that want to find friends with the same interests.

## Site owner goals
## Structure
## Design Choises
### Fonts
I have two main fonts from Google Fonts. 
'Handlee' and 'Dancing script' that meet up my thoughts of how i want a first time user want to feel when they visit. Soft and friendly and kind of playful. Using this in the Logo and as rubric. And Handlee is using as rubrics and bread-text.
### Colours
![]()
Main colour is white, with details as in navbar and footer with the gradiant mix of #A6BFFF and #A4EAC0 and for all the buttons on the page. The #F7BAF0 is used for smaller details and some hover colours and the receivers chat bubble. The colours combine is soft, beautifyl and gives the impression that i seeking for in the theme of the site.
